Description: The aim of the mapspam2globiom R package is to facilitate the
    creation of country level crop distribution maps, which can be used as
    input by the IIASA's Global Biosphere Management Model (GLOBIOM) for a
    selected country. mapspam2globiom includes several functions to
    aggregate crop distribution maps that were created with the mapspamc
    package (Van Dijk et al. 2020) to the GLOBIOM input format. mapspamc 
    was specifically developed to create national crop distribution maps
    using the Spatial Production Allocation Model (SPAM) (You and Wood 2006;
    You, Wood, and Wood-Sichra 2009; You et al. 2014; Yu et al. 2020).
