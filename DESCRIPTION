Description: This package facilitates the creation of crop distribution maps for a given country, 
    which can be used as input by GLOBIOM. Crop distribution maps are raster files that show the location of various crops. It uses a
    downscaling procedure to 'pixelate' national and subnational crop statistics on a spatial grid.
    Apart from crop statistics, the procedure requires several additional data sources, including a map of the subnational administrative regions,
    crop suitability maps population maps and any other spatial information that provides information on
    the likely location of crops. See Van Dijk et al (2020) for more information on the methodology.
