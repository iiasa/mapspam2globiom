Description: The aim of the mapspam2globiom R package is to facilitate the creation of country level 
        crop distribution maps, which can be used as input by the IIASA's Global Biosphere Management Model
        (GLOBIOM) for a selected country. mapspam2globiom provides the necessary infrastructure to run the
        Spatial Production Allocation Model for Country level studies (SPAMc). The model builds on the global
        version of SPAM (You et al., 2006; You et al., 2009 et al.; You et al., 2014 and Yu et al., 2020), which
        use a cross-entropy optimization approach to 'pixelate' national and subnational crop statistics on a
        spatial grid at a resolution of 5 arcmin. SPAMc was specifically developed to support country level
        analysis and makes it possible to incorporate national sources of information and create maps at a
        higher resolution of 30 arcsec. Van Dijk et al. (2020) provides an in-depth discussion of SPAMc
        including an example for Southern Africa.
