\description{
To quickly inspect the SPAMc results, \code{view_panel} shows crop
distribution maps for a selected crop using a panel for each farming system.
The maps are visualized using \href{https://leafletjs.com/}{leafletjs}, which
makes it possible to select a number of background tiles (e.g.
OpenStreetMap).
