\title{Creates a pdf file with maps of administrative unit locations}
\usage{
create_adm_map_pdf(param, font_size = 3)
}
\arguments{
\item{param}{Object of type \code{spam_par} that bundles all SPAM parameters,
including core model folders, alpha-3 country code, year, spatial
resolution, most detailed level at which subnational statistics are
available, administrative unit level at which the model is solved and type of
model.}

\item{font_size}{Parameter to specify the font size of administrative unit name that
is plotted on the map (default size = 3). If names are long or administrative unit polygons are
small, the labels may get cluttered. Better results can be obtained by
decreasing the font size.}
}
\description{
The function will create and save a pdf file with the location of the
administrative units in the \verb{/processed_data/maps/adm} folder. Depening on the
adm level, maps are produced for level 1 and/or level 2 administrative units.
The function will automatically load the file with the polygon information on
the location of administrative units, that needs to be created first by the
user (see Articles).
