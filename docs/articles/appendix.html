<p>The spatial allocation model outlined in this paper builds on SPAM, which technical details can be found in <span class="citation">Wood-Sichra, Joglekar, and You (2016)</span> (also see the <a href="www.mapSPAM.org">SPAM</a> website). One major difference between both model versions is the use of an alternative objective function, which maximizes the total average ‘fitness’ score’ of the allocated crops (see below for a comparison of the two versions of the models) instead of using a cross-entropy framework. A key starting point for the cross-entropy framework is prior estimates of physical area for each crop-farming system combination at the grid cell level. The final solution of the model will be in the neighborhood of the priors but taking into account a number of constraints. Using this approach at the 30 arcsec resolution resulted in very fragmented allocation, in which the area of a large number of crop-farming system combinations will be allocated to single 30 arcsec grid cells. A more realistic distribution would result in clusters of 30 arcsec grid cells that are populated by a limited number of crop-farming system combinations and determined by biophysical and economic suitability. The objective function in SPAMc is better suited to simulate this process.</p>
<div id="objective-functions" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#objective-functions" class="anchor"></a>Objective functions</h2>
<p>The actual location of crops will be determined by a combination of economic (e.g. market access and population density) and biophysical factors (e.g growing conditions determined by soil, temperature and precipitation). To simulate this process, we calculate a ‘fitness’ score between 0 and 100, which measures the economic and biophysical suitability at the grid cell level for each crop-farming system combination. The spatial allocation model is defined as a linear optimization problem in which the weighted score over all grid cells, crops and farming systems is maximized. This implies that on average all crops will be allocated to locations, which are considered as most appropriate from both an economic and biophysical viewpoint. The objective function is defined as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\max\sum_{i} \sum_{j} \sum_{l}s_{ijl} \times score_{ijl}
(\#eq:obj)
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>where, <span class="math inline">\(s_{ijl}\)</span> is the share of total physical area of crop <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> and farming system <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span> allocated to grid cell <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(score_{ijl}\)</span> is the fitness score for all <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span> combinations.</p>
<p>The second channel is the use of priors. Instead of using the fitness score to allocate crop area, we use the cross-entropy (<span class="math inline">\(CE\)</span>) objective function used by SPAM, which minimizes the error between the prior information on physical area shares (<span class="math inline">\(\pi_{ijl}\)</span>) and the allocated shares of physical area (<span class="math inline">\(s_{ijl}\)</span>) for each grid cell <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, crop <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> and farming system <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\min\ CE(s_{ijl}, \pi_{ijl})= \sum_{i} \sum_{j} \sum_{l}s_{ijl} \ lns_{ijl}- \sum_{i} \sum_{j} \sum_{l}s_{ijl} \ ln\pi_{ijl}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>

<div id="fitness-score-and-priors" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#fitness-score-and-priors" class="anchor"></a>Fitness score and priors</h2>
<p>Similar to SPAM, we assume that subsistence farmers mainly grow crops for their own consumption and therefore the rural population density is a reasonable proxy for the allocation of subsistence farming systems. As we are not using the crop-entropy approach, the allocation of subsistence farmers is modelled by means of a constraint (see next section). For the other three systems, the allocation is determined by maximizing the objective function. The fitness scores are very similar to the calculation of the priors that are used to inform the cross-entropy model in SPAM.</p>
<p>Low-input rainfed systems are characterized by smallholder farms that mostly sell their products on local markets. Farmers will specialize in growing crops for which environmental conditions are best, while market access plays a limited role. We therefore assume that the fitness core can be informed by an index of biophysical suitability:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
score_{ijl} = suit\_index_{ijl} \quad l = low\ input \quad \forall i\ \forall j
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(score_{ijl}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(suit\_index_{ijl}\)</span> are the fitness score and the biophysical suitability score for grid cell <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, crop <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> and farming system <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span>, respectively.</p>
<p>We assume that high-input rainfed and irrigated farming systems mostly consist of medium to large commercial farms, which location is largely determined by profit maximization. To simulate this, the fitness core is defined as the square root of potential revenue and market access:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
score_{ijl} =  \sqrt{access_{i} \times rev_{ijl}} \quad l \in high\ input,\ irrigated \quad \forall i\ \forall j
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(access_{ijl}\)</span> is market access approximated by travel distance to large cities and <span class="math inline">\(rev_{ijl}\)</span> is potential revenue, calculated as the product of potential yield (<span class="math inline">\(yield_{ijl}\)</span>) for grid cell <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, crop <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> and system <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span> and national level crop price (<span class="math inline">\(price_j\)</span>):</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}

<div id="s2-solving-spamc" class="section level1">
<h1 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#s2-solving-spamc" class="anchor"></a>S2 Solving SPAMc</h1>
<p>The General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS) Release 25.0 <span class="citation">(GAMS Development Corporation 2019)</span> was used to solve SPAMc. The model was solved in two stages. In the first stage, we test if the model has a solution. As we combine information from many different sources, we often encounter inconsistencies, for example because the available cropland in a certain administrative area is lower than what is need to allocate according to the subnational statistics, resulting in an infeasible model. To investigate and reveal the inconsistencies we run the model using a set of slack variables on all constraints <span class="citation">(Boyd and Vandenberghe 2004)</span> and minimize the sum of slacks. If the model is solved with zero sum of slacks the data can be considered consistent and there is no need to make adjustments. In case slacks are larger than zero, they will show where and how the model is inconsistent and if, for example, there is not enough cropland or irrigated area.</p>
<p>To solve the inconsistencies, we start by inspecting the data for common errors (e.g. data entry errors in the subnational statistics) and, if needed, repair them. If there are still problems, we adjusted the data adopting a hierarchy of ‘credibility’ in the following decreasing order of importance:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Agricultural statistics</li>
<li>OpenStreetMap</li>
<li>Cropland</li>
<li>Irrigated area</li>
</ol>
<p>The agricultural statistics were not changed, except when the model proved to be infeasible and after all other modification options were exhausted. As discussed before OpenStreetMap (OSM) data was scaled to the year 2000 and 2010 using the cropland extent for these two periods. In case OSM data is larger than the statistics, we set decrease it accordingly. If there are inconsistencies with cropland and irrigated area, values are scaled up so that they match with the statistical totals reported for the smallest available administrative unit, while at the same time, checking that the corresponding totals at higher administrative units also continue to align <span class="citation">Wood-Sichra, Joglekar, and You (2016)</span> presents more details about the various procedures.</p>
<p>The first stage is also needed to distribute the crops that belong to the subsistence farming system. Equation 10 in the main text, fixes the allocation of these crops proportional to rural population density. However, this allocation will almost never be within the bounds of the model solution that are set by the other constraints. To ensure a feasible solution, a slack variable is essential.</p>
<p>In the second stage, the slack values determined in the first stage are ‘fixed’. This means that, for example, the cropland in an administrative area with problems has now been expanded to the original value plus the slack value. As the slack values account for all inconsistencies, the model can be solved.</p>
