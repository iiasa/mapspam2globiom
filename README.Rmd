# mapspam2globiom

<!-- badges: start -->

The goal of mapspam2globiom is to facilitate the creation of crop distribution maps for a selected country, which can be used as input by GLOBIOM. A modified version of the Spatial Production Allocation Model - SPAM (Liang et al., 2006, 2009, 2014) is used to 'pixelate' national and subnational crop statistics on a spatial grid. Apart from crop statistics, SPAM input includes crop suitability maps, population maps and any other spatial information that provides an indication on the likely location of crops. See Van Dijk et al (2020) for more information on the methodology.
