# mapspam2globiom

<!-- badges: start -->

The aim of the mapspam2globiom R package is to facilitate the creation of country level crop distribution maps, which can be used as input by the IIASA's [Global Biosphere Management Model (GLOBIOM)](https://www.globiom.org/). GLOBIOM is a spatially explicit partial equilibrium model that is used to analyze the competition for land use between agriculture, forestry, and bioenergy. The model can be used for global and national level analysis [@Valin2013b; @Leclere2014; @Havlik2014; @Soterroni2018]. In the latter case, model output can be greatly improved by incorporating regionally specific information that is often provided by local stakeholders or can be taken from national statistics. Information on crop cover and the location of crops are a key driver of the model and it is therefore desirable to base these as much as possible on national sources of information. 

mapspam2globiom provides the necessary infrastructure to run the Spatial Production Allocation Model for Country level studies (SPAMc). The model builds on the global version of SPAM [@You2006; @You2009; @You2014a; @Yu2020], which use an cross-entropy optimization approach to 'pixelate' national and subnational crop statistics on a spatial grid at a 5 arcmin resolution. SPAMc was specifically developed to support country level analysis and makes it possible to incorporate national sources of information and create maps at a higher resolution of 30 arcsec [@VanDijk2020]. Apart from implementing SPAMc, mapspam2globiom includes functions to aggregate the SPAMc output to the spatial (i.e. simulation units) and crop-level (18 major crops) format that is used by GLOBIOM.
