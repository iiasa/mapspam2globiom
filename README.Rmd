The aim of the [mapspam2globiom R package](https://iiasa.github.io/mapspam2globiom) is to facilitate the creation of country level crop distribution maps, which can be used as input by the IIASA's [Global Biosphere Management Model (GLOBIOM)](globiom.org/). GLOBIOM is a spatially explicit partial equilibrium model that is used to analyze the competition for land use between agriculture, forestry, and bioenergy. The model can be used for global and national level analysis [@Valin2013b; @Leclere2014; @Havlik2014]. In the latter case, model output can be greatly improved by incorporating regionally specific information that is often provided by local stakeholders or can be taken from national statistics. Information on crop cover and the location of crops are a key driver of the model and it is therefore desirable to base these as much as possible on national sources of information. 

mapspam2globiom includes a single function to aggregate crop distribution maps that were created with [mapspamc package](https://michielvandijk.github.io/mapspamc/) to the GLOBIOM input format. mapspamc [@VanDijk2023] was specifically developed to create national crop distribution maps using the Spatial Production Allocation Model [@You2006; @You2009; @You2014a; @Yu2020]. mapspam2globiom aggregates mapspamc output along two dimensions: (a) it aggregates raster cells to GLOBIOM simulation units (simu), which are clusters of grid cells with similar bio-physical characteristics and (b) it aggregates the 40+ mapspamc crops to the 18 crop groups in GLOBIOM. 


## Installation

To install mapspam2globiom:

``` r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("iiasa/mapspam2globiom")
```

Apart from the mapspam2globiom package, several other pieces of software are essential to run `mapspam2globiom`, which are described in the [Installation](articles/installation.html) section.
